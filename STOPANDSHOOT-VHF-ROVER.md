Initial log, though the second iteration of the September rover. 
2m and 70cm station in the front seat - IC-746 on 2m and an FT790RII on 70cm.
An FT290RII and an FT2900R were used for 2m FM and sideband mobile.

The rear seat contained KG6CIH and the 222 and 6m stations. 6m is an IC-7000,
while an HTX-100 with a Ukrainian 222 transverter provides 1.25m.

Power supplied by 2x 100Ah AGM Deep Cycle 12V batteries. 4AWG jumper cables 
were chopped up to use as power cables, run from the battery with an 80A 
ANL fuse in series. Anderson SB120 connectors allow for quick disconnect from
the rover batteries, and re-connect for charging while driving. 75A power poles
are used on 8AWG wire to connect radio equipment to the batteries. The 
batteries are physically protected with the hardcore defense of a cardboard 
box upended over the batteries - sufficient for the needs for now.

The 2m/70cm mast mount is a drive-over mount made of 2x8s. We need to put 
bungies around the 10' EMT mast to keep the mast from rotating if we aren't
perfectly level. 

6/222 mast mount is a hitch-mount flagpole holder. It sticks out pretty far,
but is okay while driving. The same hitch-mount is used to hold the mobile
loops. The 6/222 mast is also 10' EMT

The mobile mast is about 8' of 1.5" PVC pipe, nested in another heavier 
piece of PVC to actually make it fit in the big pipe on the hitch mount.

2m/70cm FM is a larsen NMO270SH vertical on a roof rack mount. 2m SSB is an
M2 2M7, 7 el yagi. 1.25m is a Directive Systems DSEFO222-10RS, 10el yagi. 70cm
SSB is a Diamond A430S15, 15 el yagi. The 6m beam is a 2 element homebrew moxon
made of PVC pipe and alarm wire. It has issues, we're working on it. 

For mobile work, we have squalos on all bands. The 6m one is a homebrew one from
copper pipe and isn't resonant on any band anywhere, so it needs to be replaced.
