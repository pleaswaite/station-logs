I have a Larsen NMO270SH antenna on a roof-rack antenna. This is used with assorted
HTs, depending on which I have in the car with me. 

I have purchased a Yaesu FTM100DR, I need to get up to a car audio place to have
some power lines run from the battery. I probably could do it myself, but getting
through the firewall is more irritating than I feel like dealing with. With this
radio I'll have APRS and 2/70 in the car, as well as System Fusion if I'm ever 
in an area that actually has Fusion gear.
