Current equipment for HF is CW only. ATS4 and MTR-3B. The MTR-5B is still under
construction, I'll finish it one of these days. The ATS will be sold shortly,
too many tiny radios (is there such a thing? My brain says no, my wallet says
yes).

The AME Porta-Paddle II I have is a decent paddle, but the wire kept getting
loose and shorting out. I've soldered these on and then covered the whole mess 
with epoxy. It'll either work great or I'll be buying a new paddle. Time will
tell.

My current HF antenna is a 3 band linked dipole, homebrew, on 20/30/40. Research
has suggested that dipoles are the best option when you can get them up. I 
made the perhaps unwise choice of using spade connectors on the links. I can
currently only use the antenna on 20, as several of the connectors held on too
tightly and were stronger than the crimp. I need to correct this, but haven't
had a chance.

For VHF, it tends to be whatever HT strikes my fancy and an Arrow 146-3, 3 element
2m yagi. This works great, longest contact is around 100 miles summit to summit.
We were on Moosilauke, the other operator was on Greylock with only a rubber-
duck equipped HT. 

Plans are to test out commercial grade monoband HTs on RFI-heavy summits to see
if they survive the pager hash a little better. They weigh a ton, but it might
mean a quicker activation - useful in the Winter.
